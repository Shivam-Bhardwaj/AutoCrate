2. **Click the link** in the email
3. **Look at the preview** (live website)
4. **Comment** with your expertise:
   - "The skid spacing should be 24 inches for this weight"

   Title: Skid calculation wrong for heavy crates

   Description:
   When the crate weight is over 2000 lbs, we need:
   - 3 skids instead of 2
   - 4x4 lumber for skids
   - Different spacing calculation
   ```

## 🎨 How to Give Visual Feedback

### Using Screenshots:

1. Take a screenshot on your phone/computer
2. Draw on it to show what's wrong
3. Upload it in your comment
4. Add explanation

### Using Simple Language:

Instead of technical terms, just say:

- "Make this bigger"
- "Move this to the left"
- "This number should be 24 not 18"
- "Add another board here"

## 📋 What You'll Be Reviewing

### Your Areas of Expertise:

- **Lumber Sizes**: Is the right lumber selected for the weight?
- **Skid Configuration**: Correct number and spacing?
- **Cleat Placement**: Are they in the right spots?
- **Panel Thickness**: Right plywood for the application?
- **Weight Calculations**: Do the numbers make sense?
- **Industry Standards**: Does it follow proper crating rules?

### Red Flags to Watch For:

- ❌ Wrong lumber size for weight
- ❌ Incorrect skid spacing
- ❌ Missing reinforcements
- ❌ Improper cleat placement
- ❌ Wrong fastener specifications

## 💡 Example Comments You Can Make

### Good Feedback Examples:

```
"The skid spacing is wrong. For a 72" crate, the spacing should be 24" from center, not 18"."
```

```
"This crate needs 2x6 lumber for the frame because it's over 1500 lbs. Currently showing 2x4."
```

```
"Perfect! This matches our standard configuration for 1000 lb crates."
```

```
"The cleats should be 12 inches from each corner, not 18 inches."
```
