Work with NX CAD expression generation:

Focus on NX expression export functionality:

- Main file: src/lib/nx-generator.ts
- Constants: src/lib/crate-constants.ts
- Tests: src/lib/**tests**/nx-generator.test.ts
- API: src/app/api/nx-export/route.ts

Common tasks:

- Debug NX expression generation
- Add support for new lumber sizes
- Modify two-point diagonal construction logic
- Update parametric modeling formulas
- Test with different crate configurations

Ask the user what specific NX-related task they need help with.
