Build AutoCrate for production and verify:

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Check build output for errors or warnings
3. Verify build size is reasonable (< 10MB)
4. Test that the build starts with `npm run start`
5. Report build statistics and any issues

If build fails, analyze errors and suggest fixes.
