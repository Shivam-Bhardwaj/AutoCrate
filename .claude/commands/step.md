Work with STEP file generation for AutoCrate:

Focus on the STEP export functionality:

- Main file: src/lib/step-generator.ts
- Tests: src/lib/**tests**/step-generator.test.ts
- Integration: src/lib/klimp-step-integration.ts, lag-step-integration.ts

Common tasks:

- Debug STEP file generation issues
- Add new components to STEP assembly
- Verify ISO 10303-21 AP242 compliance
- Test STEP export with sample crate configurations

Ask the user what specific STEP-related task they need help with.
