Run the complete test suite for AutoCrate:

1. Run TypeScript type checking
2. Run Jest unit tests with coverage
3. Run build test to verify production build works
4. Report test results and any failures
5. If all tests pass, confirm the codebase is healthy

Focus on identifying any issues and suggest fixes if tests fail.
