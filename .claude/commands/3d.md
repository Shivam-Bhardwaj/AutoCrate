Work with 3D visualization:

Focus on React Three Fiber 3D rendering:

- Main component: src/components/CrateVisualizer.tsx
- Klimp model: src/components/KlimpModel.tsx
- Main page: src/app/page.tsx (state management)

Common tasks:

- Debug 3D rendering issues
- Add new 3D components or hardware
- Adjust materials, colors, or opacity
- Optimize performance
- Update visibility controls
- Test with different crate scenarios

Ask the user what specific 3D visualization task they need help with.
