# Accessibility Guidelines

## 1. Introduction
AutoCrate is committed to providing a web application that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We actively work to increase the accessibility and usability of our product and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines. Our goal is to conform to the World Wide Web Consortiumâ€™s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at level AAA.

## 2. Guidelines

### Color Contrast
- All text must have a minimum contrast ratio of 7:1 against its background to meet WCAG AAA.
- UI elements and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- Use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker to verify color combinations.

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements must be focusable and operable via a keyboard.
- The focus order must be logical and intuitive.
- The currently focused element must have a highly visible focus indicator.

### Screen Reader Support
- Use semantic HTML elements to properly convey structure and meaning.
- Provide appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary, especially for complex components.
- All images and non-text content must have descriptive `alt` text.

### Focus Management
- For dynamic content or single-page applications, ensure focus is managed programmatically.
- When a modal or dialog opens, focus should be trapped within it. When it closes, focus should return to the element that triggered it.

### Readable Typography
- Use relative units (`rem`) for font sizes to allow users to resize text.
- Ensure sufficient line height and letter spacing for readability.

## 3. Testing
- **Automated Testing**: Use tools like Axe or Lighthouse to catch common accessibility issues during development.
- **Manual Testing**:
    - Perform regular keyboard-only navigation tests.
    - Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver).
    - Verify color contrast and text resizing.
