## Advanced Orchestration Features

### Context-Aware Prompt Generation

The orchestrator tailors prompts based on:

**Project State Analysis**
- Current codebase structure
- Recent changes and patterns
- Performance baseline status
- Known technical debt areas

**Request Analysis**
- Explicit requirements
- Implied dependencies
- Potential side effects
- Risk assessment

**Resource Optimization**
- Agent workload balancing
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Dependency sequencing
- Timeline optimization

### Intelligent Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Changes** (Auto-approve for Minor workflow)
- UI styling adjustments
- Content and text updates
- Simple validation additions
- Configuration parameter changes

### Success Pattern Recognition

The orchestrator learns from previous executions:

```
SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:
âœ… 3D performance changes benefit from Performance + 3D agent pairing
âœ… Cost calculation updates require Engineering + Testing validation
âœ… UI changes need theme consistency verification
âœ… State changes require comprehensive integration testing

WORKFLOW: Major Changes
PRIMARY CONCERN: 3D rendering performance on resource-constrained devices
AGENTS: Performance (lead) + 3D Visualization + Testing
RISK: Medium (performance changes can introduce bugs)
TESTING FOCUS: Mobile device performance benchmarks
```

## Troubleshooting Workflow Issues

### When Major Changes Workflow Fails

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Terminal Coordination Problems**
   - Ensure clear branch naming
   - Use frequent commits with clear messages
   - Communicate blockers immediately between terminals

2. **Agent Knowledge Conflicts**
   - Refer back to `/docs/agent-prompts/SPECIALIZED_AGENTS.md`
   - Clarify primary vs. secondary agent roles
   - Escalate architectural decisions to user

3. **AutoCrate-Specific Failures**
   - Verify Z-up coordinate system maintained
   - Check NX expression generation still works
   - Validate 3D performance hasn't regressed

### When Minor Changes Workflow Stalls

**Recovery Strategies:**

1. **Complex Change Detected Mid-Stream**
   - Stop current workflow
   - Commit current progress
   - Switch to Major Changes workflow
   - Create proper feature branch

2. **Iterative Loop Issues**
   - Break large change into smaller steps
   - Focus on single aspect per iteration
   - Validate each step before continuing

### Emergency Procedures

**If Any Workflow Breaks Core Functionality:**

```bash
# Immediate rollback
git stash
git checkout main
git branch -D [problematic-branch]

# Verify system state
./autocrate dev
# Test basic functionality at localhost:3000
# Verify 3D rendering, calculations, NX expressions

# Restart with clearer requirements
```

## Best Practices for Orchestration

### Request Formulation

**Effective Request Examples:**
```
GOOD: "Add material cost breakdown table with expandable details"
- Clear scope, specific component, defined behavior

BETTER: "Add material cost breakdown table with expandable details in BOM section, 
         should update real-time as materials change, needs mobile-friendly layout"
- Clear scope + technical details + constraints

BEST: "Add material cost breakdown table with expandable details in BOM section,
       should update real-time as materials change, needs mobile-friendly layout,
       must maintain current cost calculation accuracy, integrate with existing
       theme system, include accessibility features"
- Complete specification with all requirements and constraints
```

**Avoid Vague Requests:**
- "Make it better" â†’ "Improve 3D rendering performance on mobile"
- "Fix the UI" â†’ "Fix theme toggle animation in dark mode"
- "Update calculations" â†’ "Improve skid dimension precision to nearest half-inch"

### Success Optimization

1. **Start with Clear Objectives**
   - Define success criteria upfront
   - Identify all affected systems
   - Consider edge cases and constraints

2. **Trust the Process**
   - Let agents use their specialized knowledge
   - Don't micro-manage implementation details
   - Focus feedback on outcomes, not methods

3. **Validate Incrementally**
   - Test frequently during development
   - Verify core functionality remains intact
   - Check AutoCrate-specific requirements

4. **Document Learnings**
   - Update orchestration patterns based on successes
   - Note effective agent combinations
   - Record performance impact patterns
