## Fix: Prevent Duplicate Expression Declarations in NX Export

### Problem

When importing NX expressions into a template part file, users encounter "Rule already exists" errors for expressions that are already defined in the template (e.g., `SKID_WIDTH`, `SKID_HEIGHT`). This causes import failures and requires manual cleanup.

### Solution

Implemented an exclusion mechanism that automatically filters out template-defined expressions before export:

1. **Added `EXCLUDED_EXPRESSIONS` Set** - A static readonly Set in `NXGenerator` class containing expressions that should not be exported (currently `skid_width`, `skid_height`)

2. **Updated export filtering** - The `exportNXExpressions()` method now filters expressions against the exclusion list before generating the export file

3. **Transparency** - The exported file includes comments listing which expressions were excluded and why

4. **Easy to extend** - Adding more expressions to exclude is as simple as adding them to the `EXCLUDED_EXPRESSIONS` Set

### Changes

- `src/lib/nx-generator.ts`
  - Added `EXCLUDED_EXPRESSIONS` static property (lines 171-178)
  - Updated `exportNXExpressions()` to filter excluded expressions (lines 1825-1847)
  - Added documentation comments

### Testing

- ✅ Verified excluded expressions (`skid_width`, `skid_height`) are not in exported file
- ✅ Verified all other expressions are still exported correctly
- ✅ Verified case-insensitive matching works
- ✅ Verified exported file includes exclusion comments
- ✅ Linting passes: `npm run lint`
- ✅ Type checking passes: `npm run type-check`

### Benefits

- Prevents "Rule already exists" errors during import
- No manual cleanup required
- Clear documentation of excluded expressions
- Easy to extend for future template-defined expressions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
