# Project Suggestions

This document provides suggestions for the prompts listed in `TODO.md`.

## High Priority

### Implement a secure user authentication system

- **Recommendation:** Use the `next-auth` library, as it is already a dependency. Start with a `CredentialsProvider` for email and password authentication. You will need a database to store user credentials. For development, you could use a simple solution like SQLite. For production, a more robust database like PostgreSQL would be a better choice.

### Add export functionality (PDF, STL)

- **PDF Export:** Use a library like `jspdf` or `react-pdf` to generate PDF documents. You can create a template that takes the crate design data and renders it into a PDF.
- **STL Export:** Use the `STLExporter` from the Three.js examples to convert your 3D model's geometry into the STL format for 3D printing.

### Create RESTful API endpoints for design persistence

- **Recommendation:** Use Next.js API routes to create your API. You will need endpoints for standard CRUD operations (`CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). A database will be required to store the designs. You can start with a simple file-based database or a more scalable solution like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

## Medium Priority

### Expand material options

- **Recommendation:** Create a configuration file (e.g., `materials.json`) to define the properties of each material (e.g., name, density, color, cost). The UI can then dynamically populate the material selection options from this file.

### Implement design templates and presets

- **Recommendation:** Store a set of predefined crate configurations in a JSON file. The UI can then present these templates to the user as starting points for their own designs.

### Add weight calculation functionality

- **Recommendation:** The weight calculation should be based on the volume of each part of the crate and the density of the selected material. You will need to calculate the volume of each `Box` in your Three.js scene and then use the material density from your configuration file.

### Create a print-friendly Bill of Materials (BOM) export

- **Recommendation:** Similar to the design export, you can create a new PDF template for the BOM. The BOM should include a list of all parts, their dimensions, materials, and calculated weights.

## Low Priority

### Add animation for the crate assembly process

- **Recommendation:** Use an animation library like `framer-motion` or `gsap` to animate the position and rotation of the crate components. You can create a timeline that shows the assembly sequence.

### Implement design sharing functionality

- **Recommendation:** When a user saves a design, generate a unique URL for it. This URL can then be shared, allowing others to view the design. You can also add social sharing buttons.

### Add multi-language support

- **Recommendation:** Use a library like `next-i18next` to manage your translations. You will need to create a separate JSON file for each language with the translations for all UI elements.

### Create mobile-responsive controls for the 3D viewer

- **Recommendation:** Use media queries to create a different layout for the controls on smaller screens. You should also implement touch-based camera controls for a better mobile experience.

## Testing and Bug Fixes

### Fix viewport resize issues

- **Recommendation:** Add an event listener for the `resize` event on the window. In the event handler, you should update the camera's aspect ratio and the renderer's size to match the new dimensions of the viewport.

### Optimize performance for complex crate designs

- **Recommendation:** To improve performance, you can use techniques like instancing to reduce the number of draw calls for repeated geometries (like slats or screws). You can also implement Level of Detail (LOD) to use simpler models when they are far from the camera.

## Documentation

### Create a user guide

- **Recommendation:** Create a new page in your Next.js application for the user guide. This guide should cover all the features of the application and include screenshots and examples.

### Document all API endpoints

- **Recommendation:** Use a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI to document your API. This will generate interactive documentation that will make it easier for developers to understand and use your API.

### Add contribution guidelines

- **Recommendation:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of your project. This file should explain how to set up the development environment, the coding standards, and the process for submitting pull requests.
