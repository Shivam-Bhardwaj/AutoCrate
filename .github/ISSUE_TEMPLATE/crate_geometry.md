## Geometry Issue Type

<!-- Check all that apply -->
- [ ] Dimension calculation incorrect
- [ ] Component positioning wrong
- [ ] Clearance not applied correctly
- [ ] Skid spacing issue
- [ ] Panel alignment problem
- [ ] Coordinate system bug
- [ ] Two-point construction error
- [ ] Other (describe below)

## Problem Description

<!-- What's wrong with the geometry? Be specific about what you expected vs. what you see -->

## Crate Configuration

**Product Dimensions:**
- Length (Y): <!-- inches -->
- Width (X): <!-- inches -->
- Height (Z): <!-- inches -->
- Weight: <!-- lbs -->

**Clearances:**
- Side: <!-- inches -->
- End: <!-- inches -->
- Top: <!-- inches -->

**Materials:**
- Skid size: <!-- e.g., 4x4, 6x6 -->
- Floorboard size: <!-- e.g., 2x6, 2x8 -->
- Plywood thickness: <!-- e.g., 0.25" -->

## Expected Geometry

<!-- What dimensions/positions should be correct? Include NX expressions if relevant -->

## Actual Geometry

<!-- What dimensions/positions are you seeing? -->

## Screenshots/Evidence

<!-- 3D view screenshot, NX expression output, STEP file details, or measurements -->

## Component Affected

<!-- Which crate components are incorrectly positioned/sized? -->
- [ ] Skids
- [ ] Floorboards
- [ ] Side panels
- [ ] Front/Back panels
- [ ] Top panel
- [ ] Cleats
- [ ] Panel stops
- [ ] Datum planes
- [ ] Overall assembly
