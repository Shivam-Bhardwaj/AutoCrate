## Summary
- Replaced toggle-based mobile layout with persistent 3D view
- Added sliding bottom drawer for mobile controls
- Simplified mobile header with dropdown menu for exports

## Problem Solved
This PR addresses issue #78 where the mobile UI was too cluttered and users couldn't see the 3D model while adjusting inputs.

## Changes Made

### 🎯 Core Improvements
1. **Persistent 3D View** - Mobile users can now always see the 3D model while adjusting parameters
2. **Sliding Bottom Drawer** - Intuitive drawer that slides up from the bottom with essential controls
3. **Simplified Header** - Export buttons moved to a dropdown menu to reduce clutter
4. **Enhanced UX** - Added backdrop overlay, click-outside-to-close, and smooth animations

### 📱 Mobile-Specific Features
- **Floating Action Button** - Easy-to-reach button to toggle the controls drawer
- **Essential Controls First** - Dimensions and weight immediately accessible
- **Advanced Settings Collapsible** - Less common options grouped in expandable sections
- **Touch Optimized** - Improved scrolling and touch interactions

### 🖥️ Desktop Experience
- No changes to desktop layout - maintains the existing side-by-side design
- All functionality preserved

## Technical Details
- Modified `/src/app/page.tsx` to implement the new mobile layout
- Added state management for drawer and menu controls
- Responsive breakpoint at 1024px (Tailwind's `lg:`)
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files
- Updated tests to handle duplicate scenario selectors

## Test Plan
- [x] Mobile viewport (< 1024px) shows floating action button
- [x] Drawer slides up/down smoothly with animations
- [x] 3D model remains visible and interactive while drawer is open
- [x] All inputs accessible in drawer (dimensions, weight, clearances)
- [x] Advanced settings available in collapsible section
- [x] Menu dropdown works for export actions
- [x] Click outside or backdrop closes drawer
- [x] Desktop experience unchanged (≥ 1024px)
- [x] Dark mode compatibility
- [x] Tests pass with updated selectors

## Screenshots
- Mobile: 3D view always visible with floating button
- Drawer open: Essential controls easily accessible
- Advanced settings: Collapsible for less clutter

## Breaking Changes
None - This is a pure UI improvement with no API or data model changes.

Closes #78
