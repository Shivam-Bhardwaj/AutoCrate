## Quality Assurance Results

### Code Quality (NEEDS ATTENTION)
- **ESLint**: ❌ 12 files with linting errors identified (as of 2025-01-06)
  - Unterminated template literal in Box.tsx
  - Multiple unused variables need underscore prefix
  - Several 'any' types need proper TypeScript types
  - React Hook dependency issues
- **TypeScript**: ⚠️ Type checking needs verification after linting fixes
- **Build Process**: ✅ Production build successful, optimized bundles generated

## 🆕 New Issues Identified (2025-01-06)

### Linting Errors (12 files affected)
1. **Box.tsx:38** - Unterminated template literal
2. **CoordinateAxes.tsx:21** - Unused variable 'axesColors'
3. **CrateViewer3D.tsx** - React Hook issues and 'any' types (lines 87, 120, 127)
4. **InputForms.tsx:15** - Unused Card component imports
5. **LODCrateModel.tsx:26** - Unused 'config' parameter
6. **geometry-instancing.ts** - Unused imports and 'any' type (lines 12, 146-147)
7. **performance-monitor.ts** - Unused variable and 'any' type (lines 104, 111)
8. **test3d/page.tsx:53** - React ref cleanup issue
9. **page.tsx:33** - Unused ErrorBoundary import

### 3D Visualization Issues
- **Coordinate Axes Spacing**: Axes positioned too far from crate at `[0, -5, -1]`
  - Should be at origin `[0, 0, 0]` for proper reference
  - File: `src/components/CrateViewer3D.tsx`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Phase 0)
1. Fix all linting errors by:
   - Adding underscore prefix to unused variables
   - Replacing 'any' types with proper TypeScript types
   - Fixing React Hook dependencies
   - Removing unterminated template literal
2. Adjust coordinate axes position to origin
3. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` to verify fixes

### Upcoming Phases
- **Phase 1**: Fix coordinate system orientation (Z=up)
- **Phase 2**: Change inputs from crate to product dimensions
- **Phase 3**: Add explode view feature
- **Phase 4**: Restore NX expression export
