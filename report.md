- **Created Coordinate Axes Component** - Added professional world coordinate system with labeled X/Y/Z axes for better spatial understanding

### ✅ Phase 3: Engineering Analysis System
- **Removed NX Expression Tab** - Eliminated the generic CAD expression system
- **Created Engineering Analysis Tab** - Implemented professional load capacity analysis with:
  - Safety factor calculations
  - Maximum load capacity display
  - Structural analysis with stress point identification
  - Visual indicators for critical areas

- **Added Formulas Tab** - Professional engineering formulas display with:
  - Load distribution calculations (W = F / A)
  - Safety factor formulas (SF = Max Load / Working Load)
  - ISMP-15 compliance checklist with visual indicators
  - Interactive formula cards with hover effects

### ✅ Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience
- **Created Tech Stack Display** - Professional footer with:
  - Interactive technology badges with emoji icons
  - Hover tooltips showing versions
  - Responsive layout with proper spacing
  - Dark mode support
