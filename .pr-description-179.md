## Fix: Remove stale issue badge display (#179)

### Problem
The ChangeTracker component was displaying an outdated issue number badge at the top left of the page that was not updating correctly.

### Solution
- Removed ChangeTracker component from main page
- Removed ChangeTracker import
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to remove ChangeTracker reference

### Related Discovery
While working on this issue, discovered that Cursor creates worktrees in a shared location (`/root/.cursor/worktrees/`) which can conflict when working on multiple projects on the same server. Added documentation in `docs/workflow/CURSOR_WORKTREE_ISSUE.md` explaining the problem and recommending use of project-specific `issues/[NUMBER]/` directories instead.

### Changes
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Removed ChangeTracker component
- `CLAUDE.md` - Removed ChangeTracker from component list
- `docs/workflow/CURSOR_WORKTREE_ISSUE.md` - New documentation about worktree location issue
- `docs/workflow/WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md` - Added warning reference

Closes #179
