  - `make tmux` - Launches tmux environment

- ✅ Created QUICKSTART_PARALLEL.md
  - Quick reference for getting started
  - Step-by-step workflow examples
  - Common scenarios and solutions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Command reference

**Files Created**:

- PARALLEL_WORKFLOW.md
- scripts/tmux-autocrate.sh (executable)
- .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
- .github/workflows/parallel-ci.yml
- Makefile
- QUICKSTART_PARALLEL.md

**Files Modified**:

- CLAUDE.md (added Project Memory System section)

**Impact**:

- Multiple ways to work on parallel features simultaneously
- Automated CI/CD for all branches
- Tmux environment for terminal-based parallel development
- VS Code integration for GUI-based development

- Complete workflow documentation

**Testing**:

- ✅ Tmux script executes without errors
- ✅ Makefile syntax validated
- ✅ GitHub Actions YAML syntax validated
- ⚠️ Devcontainer not tested (requires VS Code)

**Known Issues**:

- None

**Next Steps**:

- Test tmux-autocrate.sh in live environment
- Try parallel development with 2+ features
- Monitor GitHub Actions when pushing branches
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks for PROJECT_STATUS.md validation

## Guidelines for Logging

### When to Log

✅ **Always log**:

- Feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Breaking changes
- Architecture changes
- Major documentation updates

⚠️ **Consider logging**:

- Minor documentation fixes
- Small bug fixes
- Test additions

❌ **Don't log**:

- Typo fixes
- Formatting changes
- Comment updates

### What to Include

1. **Context**: What were you trying to achieve?
2. **Changes**: What did you modify?
3. **Impact**: How does this affect other modules?
4. **Testing**: What tests were run?
5. **Issues**: Any problems encountered?
6. **Next steps**: What comes next?

### Log Format

- Use **emoji indicators**: ✅ (done), ⚠️ (partial), ❌ (failed)
- **Be specific**: File paths, function names, exact changes
- **Be concise**: Bullet points, not essays
- **Link related work**: Reference other log entries if related

### Coordinating Parallel Work

Before starting work:

1. Check latest entries in WORK_LOG.md
2. Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for active work
3. Add yourself to active work if needed

After completing work:

1. Add entry to WORK_LOG.md (top of file)
2. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
3. Commit both files together
