## Critical Issues Fixed & Merged

### 1. MASTER-1: Panel Stops (PR #112)
**Issues:** #93, #94, #95, #96, #107  
**Status:** ✅ MERGED

**Problem:**
- Panel stops not centered on front panel
- Top panel stop had 1/8" Z-gap
- Front panel stops interfering with end panels by 0.62"
- Missing 0.0625" offset calculation

**Solution:**
- Added `edgeInset` (1.0625") clearance to prevent interference
- Positioned stops flush against panel surfaces (no gaps)
- Updated all 21 tests to verify correct behavior

**Files:** `src/lib/panel-stop-calculator.ts`, tests

---

### 2. MASTER-2: Lag Screw Patterns (PR #113)
**Issues:** #91, #92, #108  
**Status:** ✅ MERGED

**Problem:**
- Missing lags on end panels for certain geometries
- Small crates had middle lag instead of end lags
- Incorrect spacing for various crate sizes

**Solution:**
- Always place screws at start and end positions
- Adaptive spacing: Small (<36"): 6-18", Large (≥36"): 12-24"
- Guaranteed minimum 2 lags per edge

**Files:** `src/lib/nx-generator.ts` (generateLagRowPositions)

---

### 3. MASTER-3: Ground Clearance (PR #114)
**Issues:** #90, #109  
**Status:** ✅ MERGED

**Problem:**
- Side panels at 3.5" clearance (should be 4")
- Configuration slider had no effect
- Forklift access blocked

**Solution:**
- Updated default from 0.25" to 4.0"
- Fixed Z positioning to use `groundClearance` parameter
- Configuration now properly updates panel positions

**Files:** `src/lib/crate-constants.ts`, `src/lib/nx-generator.ts`

---

### 4. MASTER-4: NX Translation & Datum (PR #115)
**Issues:** #86, #97, #110  
**Status:** ✅ MERGED

**Problem:**
- NX expressions lacked clear coordinate system documentation
- PMI datum planes not anchored to physical features
- Manufacturing drawings ambiguous

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive coordinate system documentation
- Defined primary/secondary/tertiary datum planes
- All measurements from fixed physical references (Z=0, X=0, Y=0)

**Files:** `src/lib/nx-generator.ts` (exportNXExpressions)

## Master Tracking Issue

**Issue #116:** Complete testing guide and change documentation

Contains:
- Detailed change descriptions for each PR
- Comprehensive testing checklist
- Visual/functional testing procedures
- Test crate configurations (24x24x24, 48x48x48, 96x72x60)
- Regression testing checklist
- Deployment checklist
- Known issues (pre-existing)

---

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
```bash
✅ All panel stop tests (21/21)
✅ All lag screw tests (6/6)
✅ All nx-generator tests passing
```

**Pre-existing failures (not blocking):**
- KlimpModel.test.tsx (mock infrastructure)
- LumberCutList.test.tsx (test data)
- ThemeToggle.test.tsx (timing)

### Integration
- All changes tested together
- No regressions introduced
- Existing functionality preserved

---

## Files Modified

**Core Logic:**
- `src/lib/nx-generator.ts` (4 changes)
- `src/lib/panel-stop-calculator.ts` (3 fixes)
- `src/lib/crate-constants.ts` (1 update)

**Tests:**
- `src/lib/__tests__/panel-stop-calculator.test.ts` (3 updates)

**Total Lines Changed:** ~100 lines (highly focused changes)

---

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /home/curious/workspace
npm test                    # All unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests
```

### Visual Test
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
3. Test small crate: 24x24x24, 300 lbs
4. Toggle component visibility
5. Verify panel stops, lags, clearance
6. Export STEP and verify in CAD

### Configuration Test
1. Adjust ground clearance slider (0-8")
2. Verify real-time updates in 3D
3. Adjust lag spacing (18-24")
4. Verify screw positions update
