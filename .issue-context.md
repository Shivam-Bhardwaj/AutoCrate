# B-Style Crate Delivery - Complete Changes & Testing Guide

This master issue documents all changes made for the B-Style crate manufacturing delivery and provides a comprehensive testing checklist.

## 📋 Changes Completed

### CRITICAL Issues (Blocking Manufacturing)

#### ✅ MASTER-1: Panel Stops (#107)
**PR:** #112  
**Issues Fixed:** #93, #94, #95, #96

**Changes:**
- Added proper clearance offset (`edgeInset = 1.0625"`) to prevent interference with end panels
- Removed Z-gap by positioning flush against panel bottom surface
- Corrected Y-offset to use `edgeInset` constant for top panel stop
- Front panel stops now properly centered and positioned with clearance

**Testing:**
- [x] All 21 panel stop tests passing
- [ ] Visual inspection: Panel stops visible on front panel left/right edges
- [ ] Visual inspection: Top panel stop visible on front edge
- [ ] No interference with cleats or klimps
- [ ] Test crates: 24x24x24, 48x48x48, 96x72x60

---

#### ✅ MASTER-2: Lag Screw Patterns (#108)
**PR:** #113  
**Issues Fixed:** #91, #92

**Changes:**
- Always place lag screws at start and end positions (end cleats)
- Adaptive spacing based on edge length:
  - Small edges (< 36"): 6" min, 18" max spacing
  - Large edges (≥ 36"): 12" min, 24" max spacing
- Ensure minimum 2 lags per edge for structural integrity
- Proper intermediate lag distribution

**Testing:**
- [x] All lag screw tests passing
- [ ] Small crate (24x24x24): 2 lags at ends only
- [ ] Medium crate (48x48x48): 3 lags (start, middle, end), spacing ~24"
- [ ] Large crate (96x72x60): Front ~96" has 5 lags, spacing ~24"
- [ ] All panels have lags on all edges
- [ ] No missing lags on end panels

---

#### ✅ MASTER-3: Ground Clearance (#109)
**PR:** #114  
**Issues Fixed:** #90

**Changes:**
- Updated `SIDE_PANEL_GROUND_CLEARANCE` from 0.25" to 4.0" for forklift access
- Fixed side panel Z positioning to start at ground clearance
- Configuration slider now actually affects panel position
- Updated side panel height calculation to account for ground clearance

**Testing:**
- [x] All panel stop tests passing with new clearance
- [ ] Visual inspection: 4" gap between side panels and ground
- [ ] Configuration slider changes clearance in real-time
- [ ] Forklift accessibility: Standard 2" forks + clearance
- [ ] Test with custom clearance values (2", 6", 8")

---

### HIGH Priority (Manufacturing Drawings)

#### ✅ MASTER-4: NX Expression Translation (#110)
**PR:** #115  
**Issues Fixed:** #86, #97

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive datum plane documentation to NX export
- Defined coordinate system: Origin at center bottom (X=0, Y=0, Z=0)
- Specified primary, secondary, tertiary datum planes
- All units in INCHES, measurements from fixed physical references

**Testing:**
- [ ] NX export file downloads correctly
- [ ] Coordinate system documentation clear and complete
- [ ] Datum planes: XY at Z=0, YZ at X=0, XZ at Y=0
- [ ] Import into NX CAD (if available) and verify datum alignment
- [ ] Manufacturing drawings reference correct datums

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test                          # All unit tests
npm test -- panel-stop            # Panel stop tests
npm test -- lag                   # Lag screw tests  
npm test -- nx-generator          # Core generator tests
```

**Expected:** All tests pass (pre-existing failures in KlimpModel, LumberCutList unrelated)

---

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e                  # Playwright E2E tests
```

**Expected:** All E2E tests pass

---

### Visual/Functional Testing

#### Test Crate Configurations

**Small Crate (24x24x24)**
- Product: 24" x 24" x 24", 300 lbs
- Expected:
  - Panel stops visible on front panel edges and top panel
  - 2 lag screws at end cleats only (no middle lag)
  - 4" ground clearance visible on side panels
  - Forklift can access underneath

**Medium Crate (48x48x48)**
- Product: 48" x 48" x 48", 1500 lbs
- Expected:
  - Panel stops positioned with proper clearances
  - 3 lag screws per edge (~24" spacing)
  - 4" ground clearance maintained
  - All components visible and non-interfering

**Large Crate (96x72x60)**
- Product: 96" x 72" x 60", 5000 lbs
- Expected:
  - Front panel stops centered with clearance
  - Front panel (~96"): 5 lags
  - Side panels (~72"): 4 lags  
  - Proper spacing maintained (~24")
  - 4" ground clearance on all sides

### Component Visibility Tests

**3D Visualization:**
- [ ] Toggle panel stops visibility - verify 3 stops render
- [ ] Toggle lag screws visibility - verify all panels have lags
- [ ] Check side panel positioning - 4" gap from ground visible
- [ ] Rotate view to inspect all edges
- [ ] No z-fighting or overlapping components

**STEP Export:**
- [ ] Download STEP file
- [ ] Open in CAD software (eDrawings, FreeCAD, etc.)
- [ ] Verify panel stop positions (1.0625" from edges)
- [ ] Verify lag screws present on all panels
- [ ] Verify 4" ground clearance
- [ ] Check datum planes at Z=0, X=0, Y=0

**NX Export:**
- [ ] Download NX expressions file
- [ ] Verify coordinate system documentation
- [ ] Verify datum plane references
- [ ] Check all measurements in inches
- [ ] Verify expression names follow NX conventions

---

### Regression Testing

**Ensure no breakage of existing features:**
- [ ] Skids position correctly
- [ ] Floorboards generate properly  
- [ ] Klimp fasteners visible on front panel
- [ ] Cleats positioned on all panels
- [ ] Plywood pieces render correctly
- [ ] Panel splice visualizations work
- [ ] Cut list displays properly
- [ ] BOM generates correctly

---

### Configuration Tests

**Test configuration sliders:**
- [ ] Side panel ground clearance (0" - 8")
- [ ] Lag screw spacing (18" - 24")
- [ ] Panel thickness changes
- [ ] Lumber size restrictions
- [ ] Clearance adjustments (side, end, top)

**Expected:** All changes reflect immediately in 3D view

## 🐛 Known Issues (Pre-existing, Not Blocking)

These existed before changes and are not blocking B-Style delivery:

1. **KlimpModel.test.tsx:** useGLTF.preload mock issue (test infrastructure)
2. **LumberCutList.test.tsx:** Missing 'description' property in test mocks (test data)
3. **ThemeToggle.test.tsx:** Mounting timing issues (test infrastructure)

## 📝 Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `src/lib/nx-generator.ts` - Panel stops, lag screws, ground clearance, NX export
- `src/lib/panel-stop-calculator.ts` - Panel stop positioning logic
- `src/lib/crate-constants.ts` - Ground clearance default update

### Tests
- `src/lib/__tests__/panel-stop-calculator.test.ts` - Panel stop test updates
- `src/lib/__tests__/nx-generator.test.ts` - Lag screw tests (passing)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

B-Style crate delivery is ready when:

✅ All panel stops correctly positioned with proper clearances  
✅ All panels have lag screws on all edges  
✅ Ground clearance maintains 4" for forklift access  
✅ NX expressions provide clear datum references  
✅ All unit tests passing  
✅ Visual inspection confirms no component interference  
✅ STEP export validates in CAD software  
✅ Manufacturing drawings can be generated from NX import
