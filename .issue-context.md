**Repository:** Shivam-Bhardwaj/AutoCrate
**Issue URL:** https://github.com/Shivam-Bhardwaj/AutoCrate/issues/119
**Branch:** issue-119--feature--step-file-upload
**Status:** OPEN

## Description

## Feature description

<!-- What would you like to see? -->
Need a way to upload step files instead of the current mocks of the klimp, stencils etc. We need to input them as stl files so that the tranmslation in NX is intact.
 

## Why is this needed?
Like currently, the klimps are in the wrong orientation. If there was any understanding of how custom models orient in space. It will be much easy for us to position them correctly. 

<!-- What problem does it solve? -->
Currently, then vinyl are present only on the first plywood, and not the whole panel. Additionally, we have standard stencils that needs to be displayed. This will not translate correctly in the NX model. 

## Example use case
For now, we can replace all the klimps, stencils with dark bounding boxes. Once we are able to place the different decals in the right orientation. I will replace the placeholder stp file with the actual model.

Intially, there will be some back and forth about the bounding box. but it is important to visualize.  


<!-- How would someone use this? -->
We have a limited number of stencils.
