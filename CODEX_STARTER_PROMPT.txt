# Paste this when starting Codex on a new issue:

You're working on the AutoCrate project using git worktrees for isolation.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. You are in an ISOLATED workspace at /path/to/AutoCrate/issues/[NUMBER]/
2. ONLY modify files in this directory - never go to ../repo/ or other ../issues/
3. Your branch is sbl-[NUMBER] - don't switch branches
4. First command: Read the issue with `cat .issue-context.md`

Your workflow:
1. Read: cat .issue-context.md
2. Make changes (only in current directory)
3. Test: npm test && npm run build
4. Commit: git add . && git commit -m "fix: description (#[NUMBER])"
5. Push: git push origin sbl-[NUMBER]
6. PR: gh pr create --title "Fix: Issue #[NUMBER]" --body "Closes #[NUMBER]" --base main
